# Security-Monitoring-Enhancement-Project-for-Threat-Systems-Pty-Ltd
Deploying a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for Threat Systems Pty Ltd
Project Overview

​

In this project, I addressed the challenges faced by the IT service team at Threat Systems Pty Ltd, which was overwhelmed by recent cyber-attacks and operational demands. I played a crucial role as a Network Engineer in delivering a proof of concept for a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to address the IT service team's challenges at Threat Systems Pty Ltd. My responsibilities included assessing the organization’s security needs, conducting penetration testing, and selecting suitable SIEM tools for integration into the existing infrastructure. I deployed a Splunk instance on two virtual machines to gather and analyse system data and network traffic, ensuring that network configurations supported seamless data collection. Additionally, I conducted a basic vulnerability scan to demonstrate the tool's capability in identifying discrepancies within IT systems. This implementation enhanced threat visibility and response times, improved the organization's security posture, and facilitated compliance with regulatory requirements. The successful execution of this trial showcased how our managed services could streamline IT operations and support compliance standards, paving the way for a full-scale SIEM deployment and recommendations for future expansions.

 

Business Understanding

​

The stakeholders in this project included the management team and IT service personnel at Threat Systems Pty Ltd, who expressed concerns over the IT team's ability to meet compliance standards and effectively manage security incidents. Research indicated that the absence of ongoing IT training and the impact of several small-scale IT incidents contributed to decreased productivity and frustration among staff. By transitioning to a Managed Service Provider and implementing a SIEM solution, the company aimed to enhance operational efficiency and strengthen its security posture.

 

Tools and Frameworks

​

The project utilized a variety of tools and frameworks, including:

    Splunk SIEM: For gathering, analysing, and visualizing system data and network traffic, as well as setting up alerts and generating security reports.

    Qualys: A vulnerability scanning tool that helped identify security gaps during the proof of concept.

    Kali Linux: Used for penetration testing to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.

    VMware/VirtualBox: Virtualization software for managing the virtual machines used in the project.

    Wireshark: A network protocol analyser that facilitated accurate network traffic analysis.

I followed an Agile framework, engaging stakeholders for regular feedback and maintaining flexibility to adapt to changes throughout the project.

 

Project Description

​

At Threat Systems Pty Ltd, a significant challenge arose following the departure of the head of IT strategy. The IT service team found themselves overwhelmed, grappling with the aftermath of recent cyber-attacks while struggling to meet the company's policies and compliance standards. This situation not only led to increasing frustration among staff but also began to adversely affect business operations. Compounding the issue, the organization lacked ongoing IT training beyond initial inductions, resulting in several small-scale IT incidents over the past six months. Considering these challenges, management considered transitioning to a Managed Service Provider to enhance their IT support.

To address these pressing issues, I undertook a series of strategic actions.

Assessment was the first critical step in the process. I conducted a thorough evaluation of the organization's security needs, identifying gaps in the existing IT infrastructure and pinpointing areas that required immediate intervention.

Following the assessment, I moved into the planning phase. I developed a strategic plan for implementing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, selecting appropriate tools and defining project milestones. This plan outlined the necessary resources for effective deployment and aimed to create a robust security framework.

The next phase involved delivering a proof of concept (POC). I deployed a Splunk instance on two virtual machines, which enabled the gathering and analysis of system data and network traffic. To ensure the effectiveness of the solution, I conducted a basic vulnerability scan using Qualys and performed penetration testing with Kali Linux, identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within a controlled environment.

During the implementation stage, I configured the Splunk SIEM to support real-time monitoring, incident detection, and automated response capabilities. I ensured that network configurations were optimized for seamless data collection and conducted network traffic analysis with Wireshark to verify accuracy and efficacy.

The results of these efforts were significant. The implementation of the SIEM solution enhanced threat visibility and response times, markedly improving the organization's overall security posture. Additionally, it facilitated compliance with regulatory requirements and demonstrated how our managed services could streamline IT operations. The successful execution of the proof of concept showcased the SIEM's effectiveness to key stakeholders, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive deployment across the organization.

In conclusion, this project not only addressed the immediate security concerns of Threat Systems Pty Ltd but also established a sustainable framework for ongoing security management and incident response. Moving forward, I recommend expanding the SIEM deployment across the organization and providing additional training for IT staff to further enhance their skills and capabilities.
